# TEMPO Data Visualization Fix

## Problem Summary

When using the TEMPO data source, the frontend page would go blank after the API returned data. This was caused by **data structure mismatches** between what the frontend expected and what the backend API actually returned.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Field Name Mismatch in TEMPO Display**
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx` (lines 739, 745)

**Problem:**
- Frontend was trying to access: `airPollutionData.measurements?.tropospheric_column_density_m2`
- Backend actually returns: `airPollutionData.measurements.tropospheric_column_density.value`

The backend returns nested objects with `value`, `unit`, and `scientific_notation` fields, but the frontend was expecting flat numeric values.

**Example of Actual Backend Response:**
```json
{
  "measurements": {
    "tropospheric_column_density": {
      "value": 893667669428336.8,
      "unit": "molecules/m²",
      "scientific_notation": "8.94e+14",
      "concentration_level": "Moderate"
    },
    "estimated_volume": {
      "value": 9.23e+18,
      "unit": "molecules",
      "scientific_notation": "9.23e+18"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Health Info Section Crashing on TEMPO Data**
**Location:** `frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx` (lines 808-816)

**Problem:**
- The Health Info section assumed all air quality data follows the OpenWeather structure
- It was trying to access `airPollutionData.data.list[0].main.aqi` for TEMPO data
- TEMPO data doesn't have this structure, causing a JavaScript error and blank page

### 3. **Extremely Large Numbers**
- The gas values returned by TEMPO are in scientific notation (e.g., `8.94e+14 molecules/m²`)
- Trying to display these with `.toFixed()` on numbers that don't exist caused errors

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Update TEMPO Data Display Fields
Changed the frontend to access the correct nested structure:

**Before:**
```typescript
{airPollutionData.measurements?.tropospheric_column_density_m2?.toFixed(6) || "N/A"} m²
```

**After:**
```typescript
{airPollutionData.measurements?.tropospheric_column_density?.scientific_notation || "N/A"}
```

Now displays values in scientific notation (e.g., "8.94e+14") which is much more readable for these large molecular counts.

### Fix 2: Add Data Source Checking for Health Info
Added proper conditional rendering to distinguish between OpenWeather and TEMPO data:

```typescript
{airPollutionData ? (
  dataSource === "openweather" && airPollutionData.data?.list?.[0] ? (
    <HealthInfoTab ... />
  ) : dataSource === "tempo" && airPollutionData.gas_type ? (
    <div>Health Info Not Available for TEMPO Data...</div>
  ) : (
    <div>Data format not recognized</div>
  )
) : (
  <div>Load air quality data...</div>
)}
```

This prevents the app from trying to access OpenWeather-specific fields when TEMPO data is loaded.

### Fix 3: Added Analysis Section
Added a new section to display the analysis data that comes with TEMPO responses:
- Concentration Level (Low/Moderate/High)
- Data Quality (Good/Limited)
- Health Impact description

### Fix 4: Added Raw Response Viewer
Added a collapsible "Raw TEMPO API Response" section for debugging purposes, making it easier to inspect the actual data structure.

## Backend Response Structure (No Changes Needed)

The backend structure is correct and follows this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "gas_type": "NO2",
  "gas_description": "Nitrogen Dioxide - primarily from vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 40.7127,
    "longitude": -74.0060,
    "elevation_m": 10.0,
    "coordinates_formatted": "40.7127°N, 74.0060°W"
  },
  "data_date": "2025-09-16",
  "measurements": {
    "tropospheric_column_density": {
      "value": 893667669428336.8,
      "unit": "molecules/m²",
      "scientific_notation": "8.94e+14",
      "concentration_level": "Moderate"
    },
    "estimated_volume": {
      "value": 9.23e+18,
      "unit": "molecules",
      "scientific_notation": "9.23e+18"
    },
    "original_unit": "molecules/cm²"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "concentration_level": "Moderate",
    "health_impact": "Sensitive individuals may experience minor effects",
    "data_quality": "Good"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "NASA TEMPO Level 3 Satellite Data",
    "satellite": "TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution)",
    "granule_count": 11,
    "quality_points_used": 1527801,
    "processing_date": "2025-09-16",
    "coverage_area": "Continental United States",
    "temporal_resolution": "Hourly during daylight",
    "spatial_resolution": "~2.1 km x 4.4 km"
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/pages/Index.tsx`**
   - Updated TEMPO data display fields to use correct API structure
   - Added data source checking for Health Info section
   - Added Analysis section display
   - Added Raw Response viewer for debugging

## Testing Steps

1. Open the application
2. Switch to "NASA TEMPO" data source
3. Search for a US location (e.g., "New York, NY, US")
4. Click "Use My Location" or select from search results
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Page displays TEMPO data without going blank
   - ✅ Column Density shows in scientific notation (e.g., "8.94e+14")
   - ✅ Estimated Volume shows in scientific notation
   - ✅ Analysis section shows Concentration Level and Health Impact
   - ✅ Health Info section shows a message about TEMPO data not supporting health recommendations
   - ✅ Raw API response is viewable in collapsed section

## Result

✅ **TEMPO data now displays correctly without causing the page to crash**
✅ **All data fields are properly formatted using scientific notation**
✅ **Health Info section gracefully handles TEMPO data**
✅ **Users can see the full analysis from TEMPO satellite measurements**

## Notes

- Health recommendations are only available for OpenWeather data because TEMPO provides raw gas measurements, not AQI values
- TEMPO data typically has a 2-3 day processing delay, so data may be from recent past dates
- Large numbers are displayed in scientific notation for readability (e.g., 8.94e+14 instead of 893667669428336.8)
