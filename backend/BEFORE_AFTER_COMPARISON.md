## ðŸ”´ BEFORE (Raw AI Output)

### People with Respiratory Conditions:
```
- People with Respiratory Conditions: "Before going outside with PM2.5 levels at 35.5 Î¼g/mÂ³, pre-medicate with your emergency inhaler to prevent bronchoconstriction."
- People with Respiratory Conditions: "If you experience wheezing or increased shortness of breath with NO2 at 85.3 Î¼g/mÂ³, adjust your controller medication dosage as per your physician's instructions."
- People with Respiratory Conditions: "Monitor for early warning signs such as increased coughing or chest tightness when PM10 levels are elevated at 60.2 Î¼g/mÂ³, and take action according to your personalized asthma action plan."
```

### Outdoor Workers:
```
1. Outdoor Workers: "Request to work indoors if possible when PM2.5 levels are at 35.5 Î¼g/mÂ³ to reduce inhalation of microscopic particles that can trigger asthma attacks."
2. Outdoor Workers: "Demand N95 masks from your employer when PM10 reaches 60.2 Î¼g/mÂ³ to protect against larger inhalable particles that irritate airways."
3. Outdoor Workers: "Take a 15-minute break every 2 hours in clean air spaces (AQI < 100) to minimize exposure to NO2 at 85.3 Î¼g/mÂ³."

## âœ… AFTER (Post-Processed, User-Friendly Output)

### People with Respiratory Conditions:
```
â€¢ Start your day with a peak flow meter check to establish your baseline - with PM2.5 levels at 35.5 Î¼g/mÂ³, early detection of any airflow restriction is crucial.

â€¢ Take your controller medication as prescribed, and consider using your rescue inhaler preventively if engaging in outdoor activities - especially with NO2 at 85.3 Î¼g/mÂ³ posing airway irritation risks.

â€¢ Stay vigilant for early warning signs such as increased coughing or wheezing and have your emergency inhaler readily available at all times - particularly with O3 levels at 110.7 Î¼g/mÂ³ triggering potential asthma attacks.
```

### Outdoor Workers:
```
â€¢ Start your workday by ensuring you have your N95 mask fitted properly to protect against PM10 at 60.2 Î¼g/mÂ³, which can cause respiratory irritation during physical exertion.

â€¢ Take a 15-minute break in a clean air space every 2 hours to reduce exposure to pollutants like NO2 at 85.3 Î¼g/mÂ³, known to inflame airways and impair lung function.

â€¢ Demand your employer provide you with additional protective equipment, such as safety goggles, to shield your eyes from PM10 particles while working outdoors.
